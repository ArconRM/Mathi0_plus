__It is SwiftUI app with different math functions that you can use as an example for such effects as custom keyboards, animated backgrounds and other stuff. App is localized for English and Russian languages.__
***
_App has a full version on iOS (only on iPhone by now) and a calculator  for AW. Also there is [original UIKit version](https://github.com/ArconRM/Mathi0) but it is a bit worse._
***
_App is in development so there are some bugs. Also there will be more content in the future._
